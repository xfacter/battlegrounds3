PRIORITIES
	add content (more maps, etc)
	add radar
	add destroyed tank graphics?
	2. reduce A* map size
	5. achievements?




may want to look up:
	- quake physics

things i still need
	- sound effects
	- radar
	- better health display
	- swirly particles beneath the tanks
	- HUD graphics for weapons, etc
	- make decals conform to terrain
	- gameplay stuff
		+ xp system for unlocking stuff?
		+ CTF, other types
		+ scoring system

unlocks could include
	- increased special weapon capacity
	- special skins
	- special abilities
	- new maps
	- new base modes
	- new tank(s)..?
	- hmm


TODO
	- Redo heightmaps as Geomipmaps with quadtree frustum culling
	- Redo map->hmp intersection functions w/ quadtrees
	- Fix/Redo 3D sound (openAL)
	//- Change shield effect to ellipsoid
	- Change spherical collision to elliptical/cylindrical
	- Optimize shadows/tanks
	- Fix/Redo OBJ library (use individual vertex structures for each format)
	- Add swirling particles to ground beneath tanks (triEngine?)
	- Optimize utility functions/loops (create structure for lists -- see bullets)
	- Organize code -- add state machine
	- (Maybe) Redo physics

TODO:
	shield effect - small section of sphere, grows and fades from collision point of ellipsoidal shield, normal is calculated spherically
	for physics - move players on xy plane, slide up if collision
	add frustum culling to map->hmp map->hmp_lod and particle systems
	redo map->hmp map->hmp_lod: new way will have a block drawer, allocates memory in display list for every block, sets up new verts for every block,
		just moves indices at the edge to the bottom right of the seam-block to accommodate for seams (http://www.3dtechdev.com/images/lodimage3.png)
		also frustum cull
	redo physics so it works in all three dimensions instead of just 2
	add line sprites to particle engine
	remove the default crap from xtext
	add push/pop levels to xGuLoad/SaveStates
	add custom state to flip culling
	make cache for mipmap generation (see triEngine)
	3d sound lib
	fix friction/movement

gameplay v1
	tank stats:
		shields - first line of defense, regenerates after a time of no damage taken
		armor - second line of defense, does not regenerate
		heat - builds up when weapons are fired, or when enemy uses heat-building weapon on you,
			once it reaches max, if players does not allow cool down, he will DIE!! eventually.
			warnings include screen fading to red and severe motion blur (too hot!)
	primary weapons (rtrigger), each have own ammo count except machine gun (default weapon), has infinite:
		machine gun - rapid fire, low damage per shot
		lasers - continuous fire, low damage, causes gradual heat build up in enemy
		tank shell - slow rate of fire, high explosive damage per shot
		gauss round - slow rate of fire, does low amount of damage to shields, large amount of damage to armor
		missiles - medium rate of fire, lock on, medium damage
	secondary weapons (ltrigger), each use fuel from a secondary bar at different rates, which recharges, cannot use if fuel reaches zero until recharges to 75%:
		boost - provides a very short burst of speed
		shields - provides a very short boost in shield power
		flamethrower - increases heat on target
		scope - zoom in for greater range/accuracy

gameplay v2
	machine gun - overall average weapon. tanks start with this
	lasers - good vs shields
	tank shells - good vs armor
	missiles - better overall weapon. seeks nearest target, takes some skill
